### Probability project description:
<pre>
Using the Glassdoor Gender pay gab analysis dataset, answer the following questions:
1- We want to know whether men and women choose different jobs. (and if so which job)
2- We want to know whether men and women choose different departments. (and if so which department)

rules:
- only apply a test if it's conditions are met, if the conditions aren't met simply say "the test can't be performed"
- when possible calculate the probability of (type 1 error, type 2 error) and mention the probability of your conclusion being wrong.
- phrase your conclusions clearly don't just say reject or fail to reject
- Try to incorporate your conclusions with the appropriate graphs.
